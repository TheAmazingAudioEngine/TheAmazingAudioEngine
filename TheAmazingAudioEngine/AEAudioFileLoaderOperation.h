/*!
 * Audio file loader operation
 *
 *  This in an NSOperation object that is used to load an arbitraty
 *  audio file into memory.  Use it by creating an instance, passing in
 *  the file URL to the audio file, the audio description for the format
 *  you the loaded audio in, optionally setting a completion block, and 
 *  adding the operation to an operation queue.
 *
 *  If you wish to load a file synchronously, then you can simply start
 *  the operation yourself, like so:
 *
 *  @code
 *  AEAudioFileLoaderOperation *operation = [[AEAudioFileLoaderOperation alloc] initWithFileURL:url 
 *                                                                       targetAudioDescription:audioDescription];
 *  [operation start];
 *
 *  if ( operation.error ) {
 *     // Load failed! Clean up, report error, etc.
 *  } else {
 *     // Load finished - grab the audio
 *     _bufferList = operation.bufferList;
 *     _lengthInFrames = operation.lengthInFrames;
 *  }
 *  
 *  [operation release]; // If not using ARC
 *  @endcode
 *
 *  Note that this class is not suitable for use with large audio files, 
 *  which should be loaded incrementally as playback occurs.
